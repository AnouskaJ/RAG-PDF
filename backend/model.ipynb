It may be different to the amount \\nyou paid or any amount you provided when you \\ninsured your car with us.\\nWho is covered to drive other cars?\\nYour certificate of motor insurance will show \\nwho has cover to drive other cars.

We use it to understand your \\ndriving style and give you feedback. This \\nmeans we can base your premium on your\\ndriving record. \\nWhat’s the difference between commuting \\nand business use?\\nBusiness use provides cover for driving in \\nconnection with a business or employment. \\nYour certificate of motor insurance will show if \\nyour policy includes business use and the type \\nof business use you have.\\nCommuting is driving to and from a permanent \\nplace of work, for either part of the journey, or for \\nthe whole journey.

Even if you don’t \\nmake a claim on your car, it’s important to let us \\nknow about the accident as quickly as possible. \\nThis will enable us to contact the other party \\nand resolve the entire claim, giving you the \\nbest service and keep the costs down.\\nHow it works\\nTo get the ball rolling, we’ll need to know \\nthings like:\\n> Your personal details.\\n> Your policy number.\\n> Your car registration number.\\n> A description of the loss or damage.\\n> If you’ve been in an accident, the other \\ndriver’s details.\\nPlease have these handy when you get in touch.\\nOther information you need to send us\\nIf you get any communication such as any \\nnotice or form from a court, any threat of legal \\naction or similar, please contact us straight \\naway. We’ll deal with it or tell you what you need \\nto do. You must also give us any other relevant \\ninformation, documents or help we might need \\nto process your claim, and pay any charges for \\nsending such information. If you’re unsure if a \\ndocument is relevant, please give it to \\nus anyway.\\nAvoid increasing the amount claimed\\nYou must not do, or refrain from doing, anything \\nthat would increase the amount of the claim \\nwithout our written permission. For example, \\nadmit liability for, or negotiate to settle, \\nany claim.\\nPaying the excess\\nFor some claims, you’ll need to pay an \\nexcess. You can find your excesses on \\nyour car insurance details. Each driver \\nmay have different excesses. We won’t \\ncharge an excess if:\\n> You’re in an accident that we believe is not \\nyour fault and we can make a full recovery of \\nour costs. Sometimes you may have to pay \\nthe excess while we’re looking into the claim, \\nbut we’ll refund it once it’s proven you’re not \\nto blame and we can recover our costs.\\n> Your car is stolen from a private locked \\ngarage.\\nIf you’re leasing your car or buying on \\nhire purchase\\nIf your car can’t be repaired and you’re leasing \\nit, we’ll pay any claims to the lease company, \\nbecause they are the legal owners of the car.\\nIf your car can’t be repaired and you’re buying \\nit on hire purchase or a similar agreement, we’ll \\npay any claims to the legal owner. We’ll only \\npay any remaining balance to you if you have \\nthe option to become the full owner at the end \\nof the agreement.\\nPage 7\\nMaking a claim\\nHow repairs and replacements work\\nThis page explains how we’ll repair your car. \\nWe’ll only do this if it makes financial sense for \\nus to do so. For more details, see: \\n> Section 2: Fire and theft on page 14. \\n> Section 4: Accidental damage on page 18. \\n> Section 5: Windscreen damage on page 20.\\nRepairs to your car\\nIf our approved repairer carries out the repairs, \\nyou do not need an estimate, and you will benefit\\nfrom our 5-year Guarantee. This means parts, \\nmaterials and workmanship provided by our \\napproved repairer are guaranteed for five years,\\nunless you sell your car or end your lease. Your \\ncar will not qualify for repair under our 5-year \\nGuarantee if the cause is a lack of maintenance,\\nwear and tear, or a subsequent incident. \\nWhere we have agreed this with you, \\nreasonable and necessary repairs can be \\ncarried out at a repairer of your choice. \\nHowever, you must give us full details of the \\nincident and we must approve the repairer’s \\ndetailed assessment of the repairs before \\nthe work begins. We may then make the \\narrangements for the repairs ourselves. \\nWhere the repairs are carried out at a repairer \\nof your choice, those repairs will NOT be \\nguaranteed by us even though we may pay for \\nthem directly. For the purposes of this policy, \\nthose repairs will not be treated as being \\ncarried out by our approved repairer.\\nIf there is a problem with any aspect of the \\nrepair, your first port of call is the repairer who \\ndid the original work. If you’re still unhappy with \\nany aspect of the repairs, please let us know.\\nWindscreen repairs\\nWe may decide to replace your car’s glass \\nwith glass that hasn’t been made by your car’s \\nmanufacturer but is of a similar standard. \\nIf you arrange windscreen repairs or \\nreplacement with someone who isn’t an \\napproved windscreen supplier, you don’t need \\nto get our approval beforehand. However, we’ll \\nonly cover a limited amount – see ‘Section 5: \\nWindscreen damage’ on page 20.\\nThe excess amounts for windscreen repairs \\nand replacement are shown on your car \\ninsurance details.\\nReplacing parts in your car\\nWe may decide to repair your car with \\nparts that haven’t been made by your car’s \\nmanufacturer, but that are of a similar \\nstandard. This can include recycled parts. If \\nany part or accessory is not available, the most \\nwe’ll pay for that part will be the cost shown \\nin the manufacturer’s last UK price list (plus \\nreasonable fitting costs).\\nRemoving, delivering and storing your car\\nIf we’re dealing with your claim under sections 2 \\nor 4 of your policy and your car can’t be driven, \\nwe’ll cover reasonable costs to take it to the \\nnearest suitable repairer. \\nWe’ll help you and your passengers make \\narrangements to get home, to your original \\ndestination or take you to a safe place.\\nWe’ll also cover the reasonable cost of \\ndelivering your car to you (at the address shown \\non your car insurance details) after it’s repaired.\\nIf we need to put your car into safe storage at \\nany time, we’ll cover the reasonable cost of \\nstorage.\\nIf your car is written off\\nIf your car is written off and we agree to settle \\nyour claim on that basis, we will have met our \\nresponsibilities to you under the policy.\\nWe will not refund any of your premium if you \\npay annually. If you pay by instalments under \\na credit agreement you must pay to us (1) all \\ninstalment payments that have already fallen \\ndue under the credit agreement and remain \\nunpaid, and (2) the total remaining balance \\nunder the credit agreement. If we agree to pay \\nyour claim and you have not paid the amounts \\ndue to us under (1) and (2) above, we may \\nreduce the amount that we pay in settlement \\nof your claim by the amount that you owe us. \\nAlternatively, we may write to you asking you for \\nthe full payment.\\nOnce we settle your claim, your car will become \\nour property and you must send us the \\nregistration document. All cover will then end \\nunless we agree differently.\\nPage 8\\nWe’ll provide cover up to the amounts shown below, depending on the type of claim and the level of cover.\\nPlease see under each section for further details and any restrictions. If the section of your policy you are \\nlooking to claim under includes an excess, we’ll pay you up to the amount shown in the table after your \\nexcess has been deducted.\\nWhat your cover
